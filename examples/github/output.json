          "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nI use normalizr to describe entity schemas and transfer to my other package, inside which denormalization is done. This package uses normalizr as peerDependency. If the library is installed via npm, then no problems arise. However, when I use `npm link` during development, the package installs its own instance of normalizr and denormalization begins to break.\r\nIs there any justification for this behavior of the library? I expected that I could use schemas and `normalize` / `denormalize` independently, but I’m not completely sure that this is correct.\r\n\r\n**Input**\r\n\r\nA simple example with two versions of the library in one package:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst normalizr1 = require('normalizr1');\r\nconst normalizr2 = require('normalizr2');\r\n\r\nconst user = new normalizr1.schema.Entity(\r\n\t'users',\r\n\t{},\r\n\t{idAttribute: '_id'}\r\n);\r\n\r\nconst entities = {\r\n\tusers: {\r\n\t\t1: {_id: 1, name: 'Foobar'}\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n\r\nconsole.log(normalizr1.denormalize(1, user, entities));\r\nconsole.log(normalizr2.denormalize(1, user, entities));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works with npm v6, package.json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"normalizr1\": \"npm:normalizr@^3.4.0\",\r\n    \"normalizr2\": \"npm:normalizr@^3.4.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n\r\nHere's what I expect to see when I run the above:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ _id: 1, name: 'Foobar' }\r\n{ _id: 1, name: 'Foobar' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what I _actually_ see when I run the above:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ _id: 1, name: 'Foobar' }\r\n1\r\n```\r\n"

This creates a problem due to the fact that `null` has meaning here and if the property is not present, one cannot assume that the value might be null or undefined. _(I'm doing some diffing and whatnot, hence the need for the presence of the property)_.\r\n\r\n**Question/Request**\r\n\r\nWould it be reasonable to want to add an option to not omit `null` values or to not omit the `null` value so long as a property's schema is an `EntitySchema`?"

          "body": "I've been using normalizr for a month now and it helps us a lot building an API/data library. thanks for that.\r\nThe one thing that I find missing is it is difficult to have the objects typed properly regarding the schema provided by JS code.\r\n\r\nMore simply, I imagine we could at least have this possible:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n//@flow\r\n\r\nclass UserSchema extends schema.Entity<{ id: string, name: string, age: number }> {}\r\n\r\nconst userSchema = new UserSchema();\r\nconst mySchema = { users: [ user ] }\r\nconst entities = { users: { '1': { id: '1', name: \"gre\", age: 28 } };\r\nconst denormalizedData = denormalize({ users: [ 1 ] }, mySchema, entities);\r\n\r\n// denormalizedData type inferred to `{ users: Array<{ id: string, name: string, age: number }> }`\r\n```\r\n\r\nNB: i'm not sure an instance can hold a parametric type, therefore I have made class for UserSchema in this example.\r\nNB: more advanced usecase is obviously to make this work when you compose schemas, I imagine you could also express this in flowtype so things get even more inferred so user have less code to write. The only thing we can't really infer is the field that are not part of the normalization ;)\r\n\r\nCheers"
